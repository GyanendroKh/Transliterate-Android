# Transliterate - Meitei Mayek
An android app for Transliteration from English to Meitei Mayek and Meitei Mayek to English.   
The app uses a [Tensorflow](https://tensorflow.org) Model for the transliteration. The model is converted to [TFLite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite) for use in android.   
A web version of this project can be found on https://transliterate.meiteimayek.tk

# Note
Here, the term referring to is [Transliteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration) not to be confused with [Translation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation).

A quote from Google :
> Transliteration refers to the method of mapping from one system of writing to another based on phonetic similarity. 

And we all know what Translation means.   

**One thought to keep in mind.**   
*Throughout this project Translation and Transliteration will be used interchangeably. And both will be referred to Transliteration.*

# Neural Machine Translation - Model
The model is initially used for Translation purpose but with some tweaking and hacking I managed to used it for Transliteration. I used a Translation model because in the context of [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning), Transliteration and Translation are similar problems.   
It is a [Seq2Seq](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01619) Model with [Bahdanau Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf) based on [Google's Neural Machine Translation System](https://research.google/pubs/pub45610/).   
The best part is that it is Multilingual which means that - provided enough dataset, it can transliterate from any given language to any language (by only one Model).    
The dataset that is used for training this model was extracted from the web via [Web Scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) and to experiment with, a small part of the dataset is generated by a [Rule based Transliteration System](https://github.com/ProjectUNBI/IyekToEng), which in the future may be excluded.

# Features to Implement
- Support for Bengali Script.
- Keyboard with real time Transliteration
